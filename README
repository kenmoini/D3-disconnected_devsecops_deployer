# Step 1) Provision DMZ Host
First, setup your DMZ host.  This is the machine with access to the internet so
you can pull in the docker container images as well as the RPMs needed to install OCP.

This can be done by running the dmz-provisioner.sh script, as root.
Set the LOCAL_REPO_PATH variable in the script and run it, it'll take care of the rest
as long as you have the needed RHEL, OCP, and Gluster subscriptions attached.
NOTE: You need a root partition (/) to be at least 140GB in size.  I suggest creating
      the DMZ host with one large root (/) parition without the separate home (/home)
      partition.  Otherwise your disks might fill up.

Once the DMZ Provisioner script is finished, copy the created repo files and a RHEL
ISO to an external drive or media disc (or have an installer available some other way
in the disconnected environment).

# Step 2) Provision Inner Bastion Host - Gaston
Create a RHEL machine to be the disconnected environment's bastion host, we'll call it
'Gaston' because why not.  This will be installed with the Server with GUI package
Make sure this machine has two NICs, the first disconnected and the second enabled.
This machine needs at least 160gb in / partition.

Once this Gaston RHEL 7.5 Server machine is set up, connect and mount the external hard drive or
media disc that was used to bring over the repo files and container images (and this
documentation and set of scripts).

Next modify the prepare-gaston.sh file with the needed variables, and execute.
This will prepare this host as the disconnected environment's Bastion host.  Not only that,
but it will also provide DHCP, DNS, NTP services, in addition to acting as the RPM repo host.
